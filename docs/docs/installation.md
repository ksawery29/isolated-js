# 🌐 Installation
## About
Installing IsolatedJS is easy. You can install it via any package manager that supports npm registry (e.g., npm, yarn, pnpm).
It *should* run on any modern framework with no issues.

> **Note**: IsolatedJS cannot be server side rendered (SSR) as it uses the `window` object for practically everything.

## Installation
### npm
```bash
npm install isolated-js
```

### yarn
```bash
yarn add isolated-js
```

### pnpm
```bash
pnpm add isolated-js
```

## Usage
For usage instructions, see the [Usage](usage) page.
